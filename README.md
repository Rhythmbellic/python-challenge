# python-challenge
In this code we make a robot (consider it a small point) which start moving from anywhere randomly, And when it collides with boundary it rotate till a certain angle and start moving again.(this movement is also called brownanian movement)
In this project we will use python language and it's library Tkinter
Tkinter -Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task
This project have 2 python file one contain how can we plot brownian movement throught numpy and matplotlib,second show how we can form that movement in gui
In,first file graph is there in second file video is there
